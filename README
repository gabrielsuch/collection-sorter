*** Collection Sorter

It's about provide an API to order collections in SQL order by style.

Imagine that you have a Collection<Car> or any other typed collection.
You want ordain this collection by color and the newest first.

What you are suposed to do?
1) Ask to your datasource again?
2) Implements a lot of different comparator/comparable?
3) Reinvent the wheel?

What about:
criteria = new OrderCriteria(
	new Order("color"), 
	new Order("year", SortOrder.DESC)
); 

new CollectionSorter(yourCollection).sortBy(criteria);

Good for you. But now your customer has changed his mind.
He had the brilliant idea of ordain by the lowest price.
But still keep the others sorters before it. What you have to do?

criteria = new OrderCriteria(
	new Order("color"), 
	new Order("year", SortOrder.DESC), 
	new Order("price")
); 

new CollectionSorter(yourCollection).sortBy(criteria);
